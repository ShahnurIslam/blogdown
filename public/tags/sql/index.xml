      <description>I had to recall what SQL(Structured Query Language) actually stood for because no one actually calls it &amp;lsquo;Structured Query Language&amp;rsquo;. People just refer to it as &amp;lsquo;see-kwel&amp;rsquo; or as my wife calls it a sequel to a movie and that Godfather 2 is the only acceptable kind.
If you have a lot of historic data that you need to access and interrogate regularly then SQL is probably the way to go.</description>
