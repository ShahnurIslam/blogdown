      <description>I will get back to the SQL posts but thought I would post something that could be useful to others. If you want to use Python for Data Science you will need additional python libraries.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge understanding of command line functions and I found it a bit difficult to find a step by step guide on how to install python libraries .
My wife(the doctor) thought that PIP was something else medical related from a scandal a few years ago.</description>
