      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a post that is slightly different to the other posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve done so far. Rather than having a step by step tutorial on how to do something. The below allows me to work on my python skills and explain a few things as I go along.
People who work in Data Science tend to work in programming languages R or Python. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning both languages over the last two years and at the moment I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better at my Python.</description>

      <description>I will get back to the SQL posts but thought I would post something that could be useful to others. If you want to use Python for Data Science you will need additional python libraries.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge understanding of command line functions and I found it a bit difficult to find a step by step guide on how to install python libraries .
My wife(the doctor) thought that PIP was something else medical related from a scandal a few years ago.</description>
