      <description>In May 2011 the EU passed a law that affects all cookie enabled websites. A cookie enabled website now needs to inform those who visit thier site that they are using cookies.
If this is your first time on my site you would have seen the below.
I use cookies to track traffic and user behaviour on my site. My blog is created through Beautiful Jekyll and it took me a little while to implement this.</description>

      <title>New Year, New post!</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re three weeks into January so guess it&amp;rsquo;s unusual to write a new year post so late into the month.
However, I recently had a twitter conversation with John Mackintosh who is a data analyst for the NHS up in Scotland. If you look at his blog site you can see that I based my blog style on his. Long story short, John encouraged me to write more so that&amp;rsquo;s what I plan to do</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a post that is slightly different to the other posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve done so far. Rather than having a step by step tutorial on how to do something. The below allows me to work on my python skills and explain a few things as I go along.
People who work in Data Science tend to work in programming languages R or Python. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning both languages over the last two years and at the moment I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better at my Python.</description>

      <title>Pip install guide[Mini-Post]</title>

      <description>I will get back to the SQL posts but thought I would post something that could be useful to others. If you want to use Python for Data Science you will need additional python libraries.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge understanding of command line functions and I found it a bit difficult to find a step by step guide on how to install python libraries .
My wife(the doctor) thought that PIP was something else medical related from a scandal a few years ago.</description>

      <title>SQL part 1 of 4</title>
      <link>https://shahnur.co.uk/post/sql-part-1-of-4/</link>

      <description>I had to recall what SQL(Structured Query Language) actually stood for because no one actually calls it &amp;lsquo;Structured Query Language&amp;rsquo;. People just refer to it as &amp;lsquo;see-kwel&amp;rsquo; or as my wife calls it a sequel to a movie and that Godfather 2 is the only acceptable kind.
If you have a lot of historic data that you need to access and interrogate regularly then SQL is probably the way to go.</description>

      <description>You start a blog and then you can&amp;rsquo;t decide what to write about in your first post. After mulling it over I decided I would write why I want to be a data scientist and show any cool things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read all the below just skip to the bottom that summarises everything and a cool example of data science in action.
I first discovered data science accidently while perusing courses on Udemy when I was looking for courses to improve my SQL skills.</description>

      <description>Hi my name is Shan. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a data analyst based in London for a Marketing Agency, with a background in mathematics and some programming I did in school.
I discovered data science about 2 years ago and realised it was my dream job. So I talked it over with my wife and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.</description>
