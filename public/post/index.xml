      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a post that is slightly different to the other posts that I&amp;rsquo;ve done so far. Rather than having a step by step tutorial on how to do something. The below allows me to work on my python skills and explain a few things as I go along.
People who work in Data Science tend to work in programming languages R or Python. I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning both languages over the last two years and at the moment I&amp;rsquo;m trying to get better at my Python.</description>

      <description>I will get back to the SQL posts but thought I would post something that could be useful to others. If you want to use Python for Data Science you will need additional python libraries.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have a huge understanding of command line functions and I found it a bit difficult to find a step by step guide on how to install python libraries .
My wife(the doctor) thought that PIP was something else medical related from a scandal a few years ago.</description>

      <title>SQL part 1 of 4</title>

      <description>I had to recall what SQL(Structured Query Language) actually stood for because no one actually calls it &amp;lsquo;Structured Query Language&amp;rsquo;. People just refer to it as &amp;lsquo;see-kwel&amp;rsquo; or as my wife calls it a sequel to a movie and that Godfather 2 is the only acceptable kind.
If you have a lot of historic data that you need to access and interrogate regularly then SQL is probably the way to go.</description>

      <description>You start a blog and then you can&amp;rsquo;t decide what to write about in your first post. After mulling it over I decided I would write why I want to be a data scientist and show any cool things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read all the below just skip to the bottom that summarises everything and a cool example of data science in action.
I first discovered data science accidently while perusing courses on Udemy when I was looking for courses to improve my SQL skills.</description>
