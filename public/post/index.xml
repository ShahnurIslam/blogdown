      <description>I had to recall what SQL(Structured Query Language) actually stood for because no one actually calls it &amp;lsquo;Structured Query Language&amp;rsquo;. People just refer to it as &amp;lsquo;see-kwel&amp;rsquo; or as my wife calls it a sequel to a movie and that Godfather 2 is the only acceptable kind.
If you have a lot of historic data that you need to access and interrogate regularly then SQL is probably the way to go.</description>

      <description>You start a blog and then you can&amp;rsquo;t decide what to write about in your first post. After mulling it over I decided I would write why I want to be a data scientist and show any cool things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.
If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read all the below just skip to the bottom that summarises everything and a cool example of data science in action.
I first discovered data science accidently while perusing courses on Udemy when I was looking for courses to improve my SQL skills.</description>
