<p><strong>TLDR; I went to a recruitment hackathon 6 months ago and got offered a job. Now part of one of the coolest data science teams around</strong></p>

<p>As the title explains, I started a new job two months ago as a junior data scientist!</p>

<p>I spoke to a friend of mine when I got the job and he said I should write a blog post on it, so here it is.</p>

<p>I started looking for a new job earlier this year and I must have interviewed multiple times this year&hellip;I got rejected from them all.  After being really good at my current job for so long, the rejections definitely made me feel like an impostor. With hindsight, I realised the roles weren&rsquo;t right as they were either too technical or not going to further my career.</p>

<p><img src="http://chainsawsuit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/20140902-impostor.png" alt="Impostor" /></p>

<p>I then just gave up on looking for a job&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="recruitment-charity-hackathon">Recruitment Charity Hackathon</h3>

<p>One evening I was browsing Linkedin and saw a charity hackathon being advertised. I signed up and then got the confirmation email. What I didn&rsquo;t realise was that it was a recruitment hackathon. Having had all those rejections before I thought &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s just go for it, you probably won&rsquo;t get it again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I showed up to the hackathon 6 months ago with 21 other applicants. The task given was to help a charity for missing people with their questionnaire data to predict which people were at higher risk to go missing.</p>

<p>We were split into seven teams, working with 2 data scientists currently employed with the company; they assisted with computer difficulties and observed our behaviour. I was working alongside some awesome people and learnt a lot of data science that day. If I didn&rsquo;t get a callback, at least it was useful!</p>

<p>I was called back for a formal interview. My wife was super supportive and came with me to the interview beforehand for moral support, which was awesome. The interview went well and the role was everything I wanted. However I&rsquo;ve had interviews go well before and not receive an offer so I decided not to get my hopes up. My wife on the other hand, announced she had a &ldquo;good feeling&rdquo; and decided I had already got the job. Turns out she was right- at 9.06pm on the same day I got:</p>

<p><img src="/img/success_email.png" alt="success" />
Lots of jumping up and down ensued.</p>

<h3 id="being-a-data-scientist">Being a data scientist</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working as a data scientist for over two months and I&rsquo;m enjoying it a lot. I&rsquo;ve learnt so much recently and plan to share that on here.</p>

<p>I thought about changing the title of my site but decided against it. The field of data science is always growing and I&rsquo;ll need to keep learning, so the title will act as a reminder for me.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;m going to continue to update this site but I&rsquo;m also going to include short code snippets that will be useful to others and not just full blown posts.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a long journey and it&rsquo;s still going but here are things to take away:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rejections will happen, the thing is to learn from them</li>
<li>Apply for roles that are right for you and not what the recruiter pushes you into</li>
<li>Impostor syndrome is a thing, but don&rsquo;t let the fear stop you from trying.</li>
<li>Always keep learning</li>
<li><em>Trust the wife&rsquo;s instincts for she is never wrong (yes she wrote this part)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks again for reading, till the next post!</p>
