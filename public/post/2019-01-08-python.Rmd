### Pandas Conditonal Column

A conditional column is a column in a dataframe that is generated based on other column/s. There are multiple way of doing this in Python but one of the quickest ways is to use the `np.where()` function. This function is basically the equivalent of an if statement in Excel.

`np.where(condition,True action, False action)`

``` 
#import the two libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

#generate a pandas dataframe of one column with a 100 random integers
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randint(low=0,high = 100,size = (100,1)),columns = ['col1'])

#Generate a conditional column that checks if the number is even or odd
df['odd/even'] = np.where(df['col1'] % 2 == 1, 'odd', 'even')
```
    
### Applying functions to Pandas columns

We want to manipulate all the values in one column with a function with created. It's actually quite simple as Pandas series have an `.apply` method. An example below
