      <description>Hi my name is Shan. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a data analyst based in London for a Marketing Agency, with a background in mathematics and some programming I did in school.
I discovered data science about 2 years ago and realised it was my dream job. So I talked it over with my wife and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.</description>
