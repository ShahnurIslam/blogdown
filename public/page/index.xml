      <description>Table of Contents  Pandas Conditonal Column  Pandas Conditonal Column A conditional column is a column in a dataframe that is generated based on other column/s. There are multiple way of doing this in Python but one of the quickest ways is to use the np.where() function. This function is basically the equivalent of an if statement in Excel.
np.where(condition,True action, False action)
#import the two libraries import numpy as np import pandas as pd #generate a pandas dataframe of one column with a 100 random integers df = pd.</description>

      <description>Hi my name is Shan. I&amp;rsquo;m currently a data analyst scientist based in London, with a background in mathematics and some programming I did in school.
I discovered data science over 2 years ago and realised it was my dream job. So I talked it over with my wife and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.</description>
