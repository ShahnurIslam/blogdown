**Hi** my name is Shan. I'm currently a  data ~~analyst~~ scientist based in London, with a background in mathematics and some programming I did in school. 

I discovered data science over 2 years ago and realised it was my dream job. So I talked it over with my wife and decided to start this blog to hold myself accountable and post my thoughts/tutorials or anything cool I come across the web.

On this site you'll find blog posts and snippets of hopefully useful code.
