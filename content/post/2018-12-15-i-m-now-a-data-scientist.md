**TLDR; I went to a recruitment hackathon 6 months ago and got offered a job. Now part of one of the coolest data science teams around**

As the title explains, I started a new job two months ago as a junior data scientist! 

I spoke to a friend of mine when I got the job and he said I should add a blog post on it, so here it is. 

I started looking for a new job earlier this year. I must have interviewed at least 5 times this year and I got rejected from them all.  After being really good at my current job for so long, the rejections definitely made me feel like an impostor. With hindsight I realise the roles weren't right as they were either too technical or not goimg to further my career

I then just gave up on looking for a job..

### Recruitment Hackathon

One evening I was browsing Linkedin and saw a hackathon being advertised. I signed up and then got the confirmation email. What I didn't realise was that it was a recruitment hackathon. Having had all those rejections before I thought 'Let's just go for it, you probably won't get it again'

I showed up to the recruitment hackathon 6 months ago with 21 other applicants. The task given was to help a charity for missing people with their questionairre data to predict who would likely to go missing. 

We were split into teams of 7 working with 2 data scientists currently employed with them. They were there to aid with any computer difficulties and observe our behaviour. I was working alongside some awesome people and learnt a lot of data science that day. If I didn't get a callback, at least it was useful!

I was called back for a formal interview. My wife was super supportive and said she had a good feeling about this. She came with me to the interview beforehand for moral support which was awesome. The interview went well and the role was everything I wanted. However I've had interviews go well before and not receive an offer so I decided not to get my hopes up. At 9.06pm on the same day I got:

### Being a data scientist

I've been working as a data scientist and I'm enjoying it a lot. I've learnt so much over the last two months and plan to share that on here. 

I thought about changing the title of my site but decided against it. The field of data science is always growing and I'll need to keep learning. 
So I'm going to continue to update this site but I'm also going to include short code snippets that will be useful to others not just full blown posts.

So basically keep going and trying. Also choose what's best for you.


I have worked over the last two years in data science to get where I am but I realised you should still keep on working. 

It's been a long journey and it's still going but here are things to take away:


- Rejections will happen, the thing is to learn from
- Apply for roles that are right for you and not the recruiter
- Impostor syndrome is a thing, but don't let the fear stop you from trying. 
- Keep Learning
 
 *The obstacle in the path, is the path*
 
 The idea is if something is stopping you from learning something,then learn t
