**TLDR; I went to a recruitment hackathon 6 months ago and got offered a job. Now part of one of the coolest teams around**





As the title explains, I started a new job two months as a junior data scientist! 


I started looking for a new job earlier this year. Inially I'd been interviewing for roles that weren't right as they were either too technical or . I must have interviewed at least 5 times this year and I got rejected from them all. Rejection is hard and it does affect your confidence. After being really good at my current job, the rejections definitely made me feel like an impostor.

I then just gave up on looking for a job.

One evening I was browsing Linkedin and saw a hackathon advertised. I signed up and then got the confirmation email and realised it was a recruitment hackathon.

I went to a recruitment hackathon 6 months ago with 21 other applicants. We were helping a charity missing with their questionairre data to predict children that would like to go missing. 

So basically keep going and trying. Also choose what's best for you.

Every now and then i believe everything happens for a reason.

My wife was also super supportive and she went with me to the interview beforehand. 

I have worked over the last two years in data science to get where I am but I realised you should still keep on working. 

It's been a long journey and it's still going but here are things to take away:

- Keep Learning
- Rejections will happen, thing is to learn
- Impostor syndrome is a thing, but don't let the fear stop you from trying
- Apply for roles that are right for you and not the recruiter
