## R Markdown

I decided to do some analysis on my Clash Royale battles. It's card game created SuperCell and each one last 3 minutes. I've had 100 fights and tried to keep everything as consistent on my end. Using the same deck no change in levels. 

```{r chunk}
library(googlesheets)
#gs_auth(new_user = TRUE) # Use this to authorise R connecting to your Google Drive
#gs_ls() # List all the google sheet files 
sheet <- gs_title("COC Data")
gs_data <-gs_read(sheet)
df <- as.data.frame(gs_data)
head(df)
```

Now let's how many records we have

```{r}
table(df$`WIN/LOSE`)
```





## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
g <-ggplot(data = df, aes('WIN/LOSE'))
g+  geom_bar()
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
